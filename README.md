# KernelFunctions.jl (WIP)
Julia Package for kernel functions for machine learning

## Objectives (by priority)
- ARD Kernels
- AD Compatible (Zygote, ForwardDiff, ReverseDiff)
- Kernel sum and product
- Toeplitz Matrices
- BLAS backend


Directly inspired by the [MLKernels](https://github.com/trthatcher/MLKernels.jl)
